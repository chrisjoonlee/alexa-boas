Make sure you have `Node.js` installed on your system. Running `setup.sh` will update your `node` and `npm` to 6.10.1 and 4.4.4, respectively. (They are the latest releases as of now). The script will also install all dependencies and append a new README at the end of this document. Please read it because it explains what the modules are and how to use them.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Spicy-Pumpkin/alexa-boas
$ cd alexa-boas
$ chmod +777 setup.sh
$ ./setup.sh  
``` 

In the `headers` directory are custom headers for each file type. Please use appropriate headers when creating a new file. These headers are subject to change if and only if such change is necessary.
